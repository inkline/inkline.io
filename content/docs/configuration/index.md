# Configuration
## Inkline comes with hundreds of powerful configuration options to make the Design System truly your own.

### Configuration File

The [@inkline/config](https://github.com/inkline/config) package is a powerful tool that can be used to generate a comprehensive set of CSS Variables with sensible defaults for your Vue.js 3 Design System. 

By using it, Inkline now supports an **`inkline.config.ts`** theme configuration file using which you can customize various aspects of your Design System, including colors, typography, spacing, and more.

### Vue Plugin Options

You can customize the default behavior of the UI Library components by passing in options to the plugin. These options allow you to tailor the components to your specific needs and preferences, giving you more control over the look and functionality of your website.
