# On-demand Inkline CSS Utility Classes with UnoCSS

Hello, everyone! I'm thrilled to share an exciting new update with you: the Inkline Preset for [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/)! You can now create and apply utility classes instantly, right where you need them - directly in your markup.

[UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) has made a name for itself in the realm of utility-first CSS libraries as a strong competitor to Tailwind and Windi, and we at Inkline are all for it. With UnoCSS's unique approach to CSS utility classes and Inkline's focus on delivering a seamless Vue.js Design System, this is an integration that packs a punch!

What I find particularly exciting about this integration is the added level of control and speed it brings. It allows for on-the-go styling that matches your Design System configuration and CSS Variables, as simple as using the format:

```html
<div class="_property:value _modifier:property:value"></div>
```

```html 
<div class="_display:flex _justify-content:center _background:primary _color:white">
    I'm a centered blue flex div with white text.
</div>
```

Let's dive into how you can [get started and learn more](/docs/add-ons/unocss). You can find a new dedicated *Add-ons* section, with detailed installation guides for different setups:

- [Inkline Preset for UnoCSS with Webpack](/docs/add-ons/unocss/webpack)

The power of Inkline combined with the flexibility of [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) brings you unparalleled development speed for your application. It opens up a world where you can write custom CSS utility classes on the fly, without being limited by pre-defined stylesheets.

Happy coding!
